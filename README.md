This project aims to classify BBC news articles data into five distinct categories: Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport, and Tech. We will leverage three different approaches: DistilBERT-based classification, ALBERT-based classification, and an RNN-based classifier with a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) classification head. The goal is to compare the performance of these models in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score for each of the five classes or categories.
